The Open RAN project aims to develop an open and interoperable radio access network (RAN) architecture that enables multi-vendor deployments and disaggregated network elements. The project focuses on standardizing interfaces between RAN components, enabling operators to mix and match equipment from different vendors and deploy innovative solutions more quickly and cost-effectively.

# O-RAN SC AI/ML Framework

The O-RAN SC AI/ML Framework is a project that aims to develop a comprehensive AI/ML framework for the O-RAN SC. The framework will provide a set of AI/ML models and tools that can be used by the O-RAN SC community to develop AI/ML-based solutions for various use cases in the O-RAN SC.

            We have contributed to the use O-RAN SC AI/ML Framework with a use case on traffic prediction. And we are currently researching other possible use cases that can be utilizing traffic prediction. Some of the use cases we are considering include anomaly detection, network optimization, and predictive maintenance.

            We are developing a federated learning framework for the O-RAN SC that will enable operators to collaborate on training AI/ML models for various use cases. The framework will provide tools for data aggregation, model training, and model evaluation, as well as mechanisms for ensuring data privacy and security.
